# Bagging Random Miner (BRM)

* BaggingRandomMiner is an ensemble of weak one-class classifiers based on dissimilarities:
  * BRM can work with only numerical features. If you have nominal features, a solution is to use OneHotEncoder. An example of using BRM with nominal features can be found [HERE](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/Example).
  * The following link includes a working example in Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qsi1UdUKBpBdL3bJqiaoXMgjYzhBJdVl?usp=sharing
  * You can install BRM as a python package by using [pip install brminer](https://pypi.org/project/brminer/).
  * More information about training and classification stages can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/pack_brm)
  * A practical example about how to use BRM can be seen in [BRM/tree/master/Example](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/Example).
  * BRM has been used in several papers, such as:
    * [A one-class classification approach for bot detection on Twitter](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.101715)
    * [Pattern-Based and Visual Analytics for Visitor Analysis on Websites](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9183840)
