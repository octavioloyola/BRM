# Bagging Random Miner (BRM)

* BaggingRandomMiner is an ensemble of weak one-class classifiers based on dissimilarities:
  * BRM can work with only numerical features. If you have nominal features, a solution is to use OneHotEncoder. An example of using BRM with nominal features can be found [HERE](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/Example).
  * You can install BRM as a python package by using [pip install brminer](https://pypi.org/project/brminer/).
  * More information about training and classification stages can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/pack_brm)
  * A practical example about how to use BRM can be seen in [BRM/tree/master/Example](https://github.com/octavioloyola/BRM/tree/master/Example).
  * BRM has been used in several papers, such as:
    * [A one-class classification approach for bot detection on Twitter](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.101715)
    * [Pattern-Based and Visual Analytics for Visitor Analysis on Websites](https://doi.org/10.3390/app9183840)
    * [One-Class Classification in Images and Videos Using a Convolutional Autoencoder With Compact Embedding](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992804)
    * [HMMs based masquerade detection for network security on with parallel computing](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2020.03.048)
